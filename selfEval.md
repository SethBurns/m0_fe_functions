# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

- I'm really proud of going way above and beyond on the cleanUp assignment. I ended up deleting what I did to actually satisfy the requirements, as I originally misunderstood and spent 2 hours productively struggling on something that ended up taking 5 minutes to actually accomplish... but I'm poud of that struggle and what I learned during it.

- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?

- Functions are the bread and butter of applications. They are the machines that make an app work, and they are incredibly versatile with only what we've learned so far.
